senor areos, nonno Arno nnec: for way atoue ue
power of tire aspiration Waw, be left to be thrice understood,

· when 'tis plain, that a character expressive ol it was ready at

hand? The reason ol oar meeting with such instancea aa
ΔΙΟΝΥΣΟ is, that in other parteol Greece there was no capital
character denoting tlte aspiration Waao. Thia, aa well as the
other aspirativa He, was left to be supplied hy the common
norma loquendi. On the contrary, supposing· the inscription to
he AEolic, it will he liable to no such objectiou3 the power ol
the words will he τω nutans λιθω nus. Ther, which l have
prefixed to the Ο, is absolutely necessary 3- for owaoc destitute
of the article never means tlte rome. N ow my hand ia in, l shall
add another conjecture about the genuine forna os this inscrip-
tion, which Ι am persuaded has been still further corrupted.
'lhe reading, which now prevails, is no verse; and tlae language,
when considered aa prose, isvitious. The nature of prose re·

quires the article along with cvdpsas, aa wellas with σφελας, ὁ l
avdptas, or rather d τε criptas sas το σφελαι. And now we ι

have no sooner rectified the language, but what confirma the
emendation instead ol prose there turns outa complete lanabic
verae, to he thus prononnced, Twwen moon' o' τ’ avdptos aar
το σφελας· or anw hadad ημ’; lor the AEoliana might per·
hapa allow of thia hiatus, though the Atheniens did not. “ The
Yin ΑΡΥΤΟ Ι imagine has been written near the f in the later
times, by way os explicating of the audent power of that figure3
for what is now written caros is never used aa a trisyllabis.

Yon proceed edlu, “ ll l allow you your opinion, it does by

follow, that the more ancient Greelts did not wn'te EMI3 For

Greeks was sometimes pronounced El: and aa a proof of this
you appeal to Elll in the Delian inscription. But this amounts
to no proos, unless it he impossible, that EMl in that inscription
should have any other power than ElMl. Whereasl have as·
