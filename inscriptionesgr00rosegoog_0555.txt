Ol tlte first inscription both the reading 'arrd interpretation
is easy: and Mr. Chishull has given it right. Phaaodici sum
Hermocratia F.. Proconesii: Cratereut autem et Basiu et
Colum ad Prytaueum dedit Sigeensibus. Phauodici i. e.
δῶρον donum: Ι arn the gift or present of Phanodicus, who

gave three vessels, a Crater, a Basuu, arrd a Straiuer‚ lor
the use of the Prytaneum. This inscription, as Ι talre it, '
was engraved on one of those three vessels: and either at
first was transcribed ’ upon this atone, to malre the bene·
laetion known to the commoualty without door, or else
afterwards, when the vessels might be old, and new cast,
to continue the memorial of it.

The second inscription, 1 conceive, wss ersgraved on
another of these three vessels, but there is uruch more
difficulty iu reading and distinguiahing that, thau the' lornrer.
But it is plain there is mention of the same present, as in
the other, a Crater, a Bason, or Stand, and a Strainer:
only what in the first is called ὐποκρητήριον is here called
Ἑπὶστατος. This tif you suppose with nae‘ to be en·
grsved on the vessels) was· prudently done,; t'or one 'ol thern
might be worn out, or lost before the other; aud tlre same
guest, though noue was lost, might not look on them all.
So that the memory of the benefaction was rnore secursd,

, by repeating the whole gilt un each vessel.
