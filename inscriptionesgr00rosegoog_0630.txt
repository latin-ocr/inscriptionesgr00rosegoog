Resides Mr. Reuvens's co'py, aud one in the Porson papers‚
which is' by an unknown hand, and ends line 48, lhave been 18-
voured by the Rev. Dr. Ramsden, late Senior aud Deputy Professor
of Divinity, with his own copy, and with one made by Mr. Decies,
formerly Senior. These papers‚ especially Dr. Ramsden's, have
been highly useful; but alter line 47. tbe marble is so corroded
and discoloured, especially towards the end 81 the lines, that many
words must be left uncertain.
