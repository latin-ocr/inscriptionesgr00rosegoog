' native some ol the old grammariaus melre ἐπιστάτης, and some
e'rrlororor. It certainly meana ln the poet some houshold
vessel: and why not the same as in the inscription? the Scho-
liasts lrnew not what lt wss, as their various interpretatione
shew. Ἑπὶοτατος therefore we have, but the other word
ὖποκρητῆριον, which is supposed the more recent, is, except
in· this inscription, wholly l suppose unknown. It’s uo wonder
to me at all, that the very same day, the very same vessel might
be called by one tradesman‚ ὑποκρητῆριον, eud by another,
dnloruror: ench name being made by rvorkmen, when that
lorm ol vessel was invented; and both talen lrom the use ol it,
according to the different ideas of standing on and supporting.
The other difficulty'is H, and Ω, which appesring in the first
inscription, seems to derogato from the antiquity of this monu-
ment, it it be not supposed to be recenter than the other. But
, in my explication there's no leat· os that. lt one writ η and u,
and the other worlman s and o, it proves that lt was just upon
the invention of those long vowels, before the new orthography
was settled. -Nor need we suppose that Simonides first found
out those letters, but first carried them to Athens3 which in
that place would entitle him to the invention. Ἑρμοκράτους
and κρητῆρα are full asold as Ἑρμοκράτους aad κρατῆρας and
πρυτανήιον in the former older than πρυτανεῖονι il it be writ
τρυτανοῖον; and not e for H, πρυτανήιον. Ι in ηιον may be
either pronounced and malre a syllable3 or be adjunctum (that
ia, ἰῶτα subscriptum) in the AEolian manner, as lrememher
these two verses of Sappho in Hephaestion:

Nay, to me, though both worlrmen seem illiterato enough,
the one having oranius, the other σιγενοῦσι, neither words
grammatically spelt3 yet the engraver of the latter meme the
more ignorant, He inderetis tud αἳσοποο, derebt, villulis ”l’l’

But we must correct then twenty authors who have it iu tha
compound α’πηθεῐν and οἱπῆθημας and not (as the aspirate would
require it) riqlodeiv aud α’φάθημα. Audeo it is αὖπίδολφος
and not aspirata oddddahpor. The latter's ignorante too
