thereis no reason to imagine, that this ierb was ever used by
the Greeks without the Ι subjoyned to the Ο. That it bas
sometimes that form 'iu the present editt. and perhaps MSS.
amounts to nothing: nor is it of any moment, that ποιεῖν often
has the first syllable short, for indeed it cannot be otherwise,¹
unless the l be doubled in pronunciation. But to allow, that'
there is no blrrnder iu the form ΕΠΟΕΙΣΕΝ, it' can only be an
argument, that El was sometimes usedlinstead ol the common

. way of writing H. But this is foreign to the present dispute.

Instead of Elllll aud ΣΙΓΕΥΕΥΣΙ, which are in Shuclrford’s
copy, the other ss you acquaiut me has ΕΜΙ and ΣΥΚΕΕΥΣΙΝ.Ι
Such sdifference as this disqualifies both copies for being of
sny authority with respect to these two words: nay. the credit
of the whole inscription is affected by it. Let me add, that,
probably, st least, they both give the latter word an absurd
form. There seems to be no reason for donbtiug, that' rt should
be ΣΙΙἘΙΕΥΣΙΝ according ιο that of ΣΙΙῈΙΕΣ. Upon the
whole, ιιο part of the inscription can be justly allowed to have
any weig ⁰''ht ιιι tlre present controversy, except the two words
llPYTANElON arrd ursulus: and for whether of us these
declare, lneed not mention. And here be pleased to consider,
whether rt would not bave been ιιι extravagsnt wuntonncss to
intend, that the latter Es ru ΣΙΓΕΙΕΣ should be pronounced El,
when this very power is in the preceding syllable expressed in
full. Yon meet with nothing similar in the use of 0.

Another authority referred ιο iu your Cornmentary is the
Delian Inscriptiou. To this lobjected, that the inscription was
AEolic‚ aud that, therefore, the power ol the verb ΕΜΙΙ was
there not ElMl bntllMl. You reply‚'“lst. Ifl maintain, .
that EMI is archaicd for Elllll, and you, that it is AEolicd, our
assertione are not binding, the one upon the other; but there
must be somethirdjudgnreut, some other topic ιο be concluded
by.'' l answer, that supposing neither of us could give areason,
vwhereby his hypothesis might appear the more probable, 'onr as·
sertious would amount ιο no more than if we had both been
silent. So that even upon that footing the authority of this ιιι·
scription would be set aside, aud that would bc enough for my ’
purpose. But further, the digamma f which appears in the
inscription, isa strong argument for its being AEotic: for that
the digammalwas peculiar to that-dialect rs at least highly pro·
