and trees and pots speak in AEsop's Fahles‚ yet even
AEsop's beasts talk with more propriety. than their master
is supposed todo here.

l can scarce think Mr. Chishull in earnest, when he
would do such honour to this supposed statue. AEsop was
no statuary, he is not said to have had 'Adehrpol any
brothers. It is singular and without examples¹, that three
artificers should be ascribed to une statne: nor can hlenpol
ever be allowed to mean no more than ,Συνεργοὶ Ι

Well: il the statue is turned to Phanodicns himself,
when he tells us he gave the vessels, yet in the nextclause,
he is a mere statue again3 il any mischance, says he,
happens to me, the Sigeans are to mend me: Ι was made
by AEsop and his hrethren. And yet he speaks like a pot
more than a statne: sor if a statue is¹ delaced it cannot
be mended, bnt a new one must be made. But, a pot
hruised or craclrerl may easily find a doctor.

Mr. Chishull reads those words thus: 'Edu h? τι πάσχω
μελεδα, ι’νεντ [ἑῶ] σι’γωεῐς. But he finds great difficulty
in accounting sor the dot and space in the middle of-pehsda .wsv.
He dislikes also ἐῶ, sino: because then there is a letter
erased and not accounted sor. He prefers therefore ἐρέω
dicam, jnbeho: but he does not reflect that this w'ay he

. makes a letter e too much. Besides that, allowiug ἐρέω it

must not be σιγειεῖς, but σιγέιευσιν or ur‘yelsow. I cannot
but think he will allow my ἵν’ duddo to be true and certain.

The difficulties that induced Mr. Chishull to think the ‘
npper inscription more recent than the other, and to be
an interpolation of it, are these: that the letters H and
Ω are there, but in the lower, in their stead E, 0: that it
is ὑποκρητὴριον ἱη the upper, hut in the lower (a word
he says unheard of to us) ἐπίστατος. Now both the differences
ol waiting and ol that word are easily accounted sor in my
explication. For the two inscriptions are transcripta froin the
engravings on two vessels made hy different artists; each
of which spelt and spoke his own way.

'Errlorcros is not so unknown a word, we read in Aris·
