VAS DODWELLIANUM.
Cf. p· 73.

Tua villagers ο1 Μετῐὲεε informed rne, that a Jevr ol'
Corinth, who had lately been digging in this spot, had lound
several vases. On my return to Corinth, Ι immediately called
upon him, and found them heaped in a comer, with other
rubbish. He, however, knew, or pretended to know, the velue
ο1 an inscribed vase, which he showed me; and which, with
soore difficulty, 1 bought ol him. The design os the figures, and
the forms ol the letters, are ο1 the most ancient charactev; and
probably no vase ο1 terra-cotta has yet been discovered tha't be-
longs to aperiod so remote. It is divided into two compart-
ments, one above the other, in which are lions, bulla, stage,
goats, birds, aud flowers, which are nothistorical, but merely
ornamental. The cover, however, is ο1 the greatest inteream
it represents the chose of a wild bour, in which the name ο1
each of the actors is written by his side, in letters of the most
ancient date. The subject is opeued by s figure dressed in a
long garment, and carrying acnduceus in his right hand, with
the inscription ArAMuMNON,¹. The next figure is a female
named ΑΛΚΑ. She places her right hand on the head ο1 a
boy, who holds a parazouiors, or short sword, in his left haud,
and whose nemeis ΔΟΡΕΜΑΧΟΣ, written from right to left.
The next figure is a female named ΣΑΚΕΣ, holding a singular
and indefinite object in her hand. This appears to be the con·
clusion ο1 the subject, asa birdis placed after this ligure, which
is often found on the most ancient vases, marking the termina·

tion os the story, or the separation ol one subject from another.
The figure which commences the other subject is ΑΝΔΡΥΤΟΣ,

¹ The inscriptions are h'ere given in letters of the common form, in
order to render them legible.
