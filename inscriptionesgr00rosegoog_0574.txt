which he produces in conformity with a canon ol Dawes, that e
is never put for et, it needs no remark; he having in the same
page translated bis present optative by a past subjunctive “scri-
teret ‚·'’ and not recollecting that βασίλεος and βασίλεως are the
regular Doric arrd Attic genitives in the example which be cites ;
and that so sar lrom thee and er not being commutable in dif-
ferent dialects, they are commutable in the same3 the coins oi
Agathocles having ΑΓΑΘΟΚ ΛΕΟΣ or ΑΓΑΘΟΚΛΕΙΟΣ, accord·

the same verb.

Hesychius interprets ἑφιερεῖα to be τὰ e'rrl τοῖς ἱερείοις dero-
llodneva, which affords a meaning sufficiently near to that here
required for the επιαρον before written, namely, the talent of
silver to be paid as an expiatory fine to Jupiter, ἕνεκα τῶν harper-
αμένωνς nor is the form more different than difference of dialect
may reasonably account lor. Mr. J. M„ indeed, divides aud
rendere the last words in the plate‚ iada ἐπί ἱερῷ κ’ ἐνέχσιτο τῷ
dearilla ’γεγραμμένῳ which an ordinary maker of Latin ver-
sione, preserving‚ even when guessing at the unintelligible, some
regard to tense, senae, and syntax, might perhaps translate, “ bio
sacro obstringetur ltine scripto,’' or “qaod ltine scriptum est:”
but Mr. J. M„ with more justice, treats his own Greek as it
deserves, and scarcely retains¹ a traee ol it in his own equally
original Latin, “ ltic od templum inhiberetur eo quod ibi scripturn
est:’' Surely it might have occurred to him, that it ἱερῷ signi-
fied either the temple, or the fine, it would require the article
τῷ ἰςρῷ; and that, since cirri can neither stand alone, nor be
joined with ἑνέχοιτο to ἱερῷ, some word, such aa συμμαχίας,
is wanted to malie a sentence-ieri τῆς συμμαχίας aqi ἱερῷ dv
ἑνὲχαιτο.
