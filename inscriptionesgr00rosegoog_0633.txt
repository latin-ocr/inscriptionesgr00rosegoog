’ Υοιι mention p. v. the oracle in Herodotus 1. 47. as given by
Muratori from some traveller’s papers. He had it from Cyriacus
Anconitanus, No. 198. quoted by Wesseling. This ie probably one
instance in which the editor’a delinqucacies have been laid to the
charge ol Cyriacus, and have brought his veracity in question.
(Maffei Art. Crit. Lap. p. 56.) He certainly does seem to say,
that he suvv the original at Delphi; Ibidem justo [juxto] outi-
quissimam quercum in medio amphitheatri ud nsugnum qt mnr-
moreum lapidem. And why may not the oracle have been taken
from Herodotus and put up as nn ornamental inscription, public
or private¹l The two first lines, especially, might have served
aa a motto sor fifty things; and the editor, οι an intermediate
scribe, might very well fancy that Cyriacus had omitted the rest
as being extant iu well known books. One thing is evideut,
that¹ rporaspn' olo χελώνης, line 3. came from the printed
Herodotus.

P. 16. The leucadian inscription is so wretchedly copied,
that some license must be given to conjecture. The sense seems
to have beau something ot this aort; .·.
