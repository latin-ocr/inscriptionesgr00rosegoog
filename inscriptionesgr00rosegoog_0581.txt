364 ιιιιιοιι.

, Μι. K. first represents this famous decree as it stands ιιι tbe
edition οι Glareanus, with the marginal ιιιιιιιοιιις neat ιι ιι
is given by Gronovius3 thirdly, ιι the Bishop of Chester has
publisbed it, with the ιιιιοιιι readings οι the Orlord Mss.;
and lartly‚ as the learned prelate himself would read it. Μι.
Knigbt decides, however, that most οι the Bishop’s emenda·
tinas are either adnecessary, οι tend ιο eject every ιιιιιοιιι
provincial peculiarity that is not readily understood, and ιο fill
ιιι place with a word ιἰοοι the known dialects.

The Bishop would write Τιμοσιορ lor Τιμοθιοι, ιισοριξιι
(ιι ιιι suppose) for κιθαρισιν, and μυσοι sor nider: bnt Μι.
Κ. thinks that this difference was conlined to the pronunciation

alone, and did aot effect their orthograpby. Are we then ιο ¹

suppose that, in all the placesin which Aristophanes employs

the σ for the θ, he only means ιο accommodate the Lacedaemonian χ

pronunciation ιο the Attic ortlrography? lf we be certain οι
any thing, wa ιιι ιιιιιιιι that they ιι least wrote σιοι for θεοι,
though we are willing ιο grant Mr. Κ., bat for another reason,
that the Lacedaemonians did ιιοι write Τιμοσιορ ιιι this decree.
Mr. Κ. abjecte to μοσοι, because it would conlound μυθοι
with a different word, but his οιιιι piru is liable to the same
objection. We think that no doubt can be entertained ot‘ rursc-
τοτορ, which ts also approved by Μι. K: but we cannot
agree with his ατιιιοσιι, sor ατιμασδιι, ιι the present time
seems necessary. Οιιι οι norror others have made ποιων, with
which Μι.Κ. ιι ιιοι contentari, preferring ποιτιιν, which rr
put lor ποισαν, which is put for rorensem We ιιι almost
tempted to suspect sonte grievous mistske of the prese in tbis
passage.

After (ιιιοχθαι, ιὀιιοιιι φα οι φαρ. which tlre editor of
the deorse rejects: but Mr. K. thinks that it related either ιο
the s'enate which enacted, οι ιο the senator who mered, the
dacre03 probably ιο tlre latter. Allowing this, what part ol
speech is φα οι φορι-Τιιιι our readers may jndge what clear,
pleasant and consistent things ιιιιοιιι readings sometimes ere,
we will give them a very short passage οι this ιιιιιοιιι decree,
accomponied with the aerdfid collatioris. The first we take frons
Glareanus:
