armed with a large Argolic shield, with lcnemider, with the
κοντος, or δολιχοσκιον εγχος (the long spesr), which he ir
darting at the bour, and wearing s short vert or cuirass, not
reaching to his knees. The next to this is quON, who is
running, and in theoct ofshooting nt the boar with his bow and
arrow3 his quirer is hanging on bis beck, and his head is

' srnred withs helmet, embellished with s bigb lophos, or erest.

After this ligure is planeda bird smaller than that above-men·
· tioned, which appears to be only an omement to fill up the
spsce, and not n stop to the subject. This continues with the
wild bour, which is already pierced behind with two κοντα, or

long spesve, and three ακοντια, or short ones, ahot from the '

bow of Paphon. Under the animalis the ligure of one of the
hunters, named ΦΙΛΟΝ, holding s long spesr, bnt extended
on the ground, as if killed by the hoar, which is running at full
speed‚ and is met by θΕΡΣΑΝΔΡΟΣ, who pierces bis head
witha sword. Only one of the ligures is armed with a helmet,
and one with a shield3 this is the termination of the subject.
The remaining part of the cover is occupied by two winged
sphinxes, with human heeds, sod the bodies and feet of lious;
they face each other, and are couched upon their hinder legs,
the foremost being erect: between them is a bird resemblinga
swan. The ligures were evidently drawn with great care, end
executed with difficulty, before the fecility of efter times hed
been atteined. No better specimen of the nnimprored srcbaic
style con well be seen: there is a natursl motion in sll the
ligures, attended, however, with the rigid formality and elebo-
rnte stiffness of the earliest antiquity. The vase is the colonr
of bonwood, being a light yellow3 the ligures are composerl of
the two colonrs, bleck end darlr red; the muscles of the body,

¹ and the pleits of the vests, are represented by the paint being

scratehed witha sharp instrument until the natursl colour of tbe
earth is seen. The earth is extremely line, nnd the vase is
surprisingly light end thin. It is difficult, and indeed impossi-
ble tn determine its age; tbe style of the design‚ however, but
more particularly the very ancient and curicus form of the letters,
induces rne to pisce it sbout 700 years before the Christian era.
