340 APPENDIX.

not from the mutter of the inscription, it hes no bssis to
support it. Indeed u ststue has nothing to do with s Pry-
taneum, n hall, a dining-room for the magistrates snd
strarrgcrs of' note, where there was ' guod cheer at the
public charge. Mr. Chishull, in bis learned notes, hes
shewed this, sud a whole book might be writ about it.
Bcsides s statue is quite disproportioned to so smull a benc·
fection ss three vessels for drinking, which probably were
but of copper. And, that in those early days, when this
inscription was made, statuarios were either noue or very
few, especially in so mean a town as Sigeum. Thu tlre
upper inscription should be s whole age junior to the lower,
is improbable st first thought. lf one is younger then the
other, surely the lower. Would any one leave the upper,
the conspicuous psrt of tbe' stone, bare: and write the in·
scriptino at the bottom, to be fouled by the soil, end ι
covered by the nettles?

llut abore all, the improprieties of style, if the inscrip-
tion is spoken of Phsuodicus or his statue, ere most shocking
and indeferrsible.

person resembled by the statue.

:tud l gave three vessels to the prytaneum. What! The
statue gave thc vessels? Tell us not so for common
sense's sake. And yet⁴ take notice, if theuppersborter in-

scription is not allowed to bc original and coeval to 3

the lower, this construction is necessary, and ια’·γῶ must
needs be referred to the following clause, and not, as l
hsrve done it, to the preceding. Mr. Chishull is sensible
enough of this gross absurdity of speecb3 but he, out of
fondness to this inscription, being willing to make the

famous AEsop the statuary here, would pelliste the flsvr i

with a more prorsus AEsopico, as if AEsop mede both
statue and inscription too. But it will not do, though bessts
