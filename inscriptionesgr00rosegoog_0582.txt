genuine reading, cantant· be lar from it 2-but, il' any man liles
marginal readings better, let him take the following:

roris βασιλὲαρ. τῶν paropsis.
These various readings are also very good. The Oxl'ord
edition reads thus in the text—oh< eadum τορ ueop deducire. Aa·
δοχθαι φα περι τουτοιν vop βασιλεαρ και, ‘rep εφορορ μεμ·

durrat Τιμοθεον.
Various readings.

James Gronovius has made his copy more intelligible, hut
he does not seem to have rigidly adhered to MSS. He, too,
has inserted φαν. Perhaps εἶπα (lrom Glareanus’s svam) might
serve, if Mr. K.'s idea be approved. Errnvauorm is written in
most MSS„ which Mr. Κ. derives from oros, cure, ανακως,
caresully5 whence ἐπανακεω, or -καω, erraveram, annuo·
καται. Such violent strainiug to male the text literally agree
with the reading ol the MSS. would be justly liahle to suspicion
in any antient Greek author. whose works had been transcribed
by Greelr copyers, and had come down to us iu a tolerable
state of correctness 2-but, when we consider lrow miserably the
Latin scribes mangled or murdered the Greeh passages which
their authors quotedt many ol' which are left in a desperate
condition, ⁴unless we shall light on MSS. of greater age and
worth than we have hitherto had the good fortune to find; in
this labyrinthos various readings, or rather ol varieties ol' blun-
dem, it would he rash to promise ourselves a clue to direct us
always to the genuine reading. ln cases dl dialect, particularly,
these MSS. ol Boethius ought to be discarded as incompetent
witnesses. We shall only add that the late Mr. Toup, having
occasion to spealr ol this decree, on which he would probably
have tried his alrill il he had not found the errore too numerous
and obstinate, dismissed it, only calling it corrupto corruptius.
(In Suidam, v. Χιαζειν.)

Lest it should be said of us that we are apt enough lo oh·
ject to the opinions ol others, without giving theman oppor-
tunity of making reprisals, we will present Mr. Κ. with the

· latter part of the decree, as we think it probably ought to he
read :

Δέδοχθαι περὶ τούτων ‘reip βασιλέαρ καὶ reip Ἐφόρωρ
μέμψασθαι Τιμόθεον, ἔπανᾶγκαξαι dd uni τᾶν ἕνδεκα χορδᾶν
