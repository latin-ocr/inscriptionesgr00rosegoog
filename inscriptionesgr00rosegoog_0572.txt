ly expressed by ἐς ἄρχον de'ruroar and as ior the reading
which hasbeen proposed by Mr. J. M. iu No. XXlI. ol this
Journal, ΔΕ ΚΑ ΤΟΙ ior dd nard τῷ it is sufficient to observe
that rard never governed a third case in any dialect or rnode of
speech huown ιο the Greeks.

The sense oi what follows in the inscriptionis sufficiently
obvious, and may be thas rendered in English: ἱ
“ Bat ifany thing ae wanted or required, either in speech or
action, let thern ossist each other in all other matters, and also
srorn or against war,- bat iftlrey do not so assist, [annoanlo
hysoiling may hane aialated tle trenty, papa taient of silrer to

he a citizen, a frea inhabitant paying public corrtribations, or
merely a free inhabitant, rla violate what nray he herein written,
let him also ha tela in the fine <ff expiation herein written.”

The verb σύνειμι is frequently used in the sense here eup-
posed3 which is, indeed, absolutely necessary ιο make the
treaty signily any thing: for what sort cl an alliance or συμμαχία
would it'be, which merely required the contracting parties, “
when any matters of difference should asise, to meet and discues
thern without war3 which by the bye παρὰ πολέμου cannot
mean: it would be ἄνευ πολέμου.

Totis not only the legitimate sarm of the article or proooun
io the nominative plural of the Doric nod AEolic, bnt the only
form used in the genuine remains ol those dialects; as io the
treaties between the anedaemorrinns and Argives in the fifth
hook ol Thucydides. The abore cited critic, however, joina his
income contractiori ol rard to the participle taken in ιι passive
sense, and applies the compound to Jupiter, τῷ Aa Ὀλυμπίῳ
τῷ raradcdnhnndvp, not giving himself the trouble ιο ascertain
that the verb dnhdoanr only occurs ina passive or middle form
