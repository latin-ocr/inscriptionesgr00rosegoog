and Argia, who was with the Greeks at the Trojan war. The
hunt, which is here represented is unknown in ancient history.
Those which have come down to usare the chase ol the Caly·
donian honr, and that ol Parnassos, where Ulysses was wound-
ed ¹. The Cromyon sow, and Erymanthian bear, which were
killed by Theseus and Hercules, seem not to have afforded the
opportunity ol a general hunt, lilre the two above-mentioned.
The wild hoar chase is not an uncommon delineation on
fictile vases. There is one of great interest and remote antiqui·
ty, in the collection of Sir W. Hamilton‚ which is at presentia
the British Museuni ². It has been supposed that these' vases
were the Theriklesn cups, celebrated in antiquity, and thus

ἱ · named from their maier Therikles³. lt appears that the ma·

nufacture was not confined to any particular material. In
Dr. Bentley's dissertation upon Theriklean cupa, are cited the
authors, who have written on this subject.

These tombs probably did not contain vassa of such salue
as those found in the sepulchres of Corinth3 all ol which,
Strabo* says, were opened in the dme of Julius Caesar, when
the earthen and bronze vases⁵ found in them were sold lor high
prices, and sent to Rome. Tbat city was thus copiously sup· ¹
plied with the vases that had been interred with the Corinthian
dead ⁸. The vein ol earth being lost, they became scarce3 and
the value· was enhauced, not only by their great rarity, butby
their wonderful beauty. This introduction of objecta of Corin-
thian art must have beena source os improvement t‘or Roman
artists, by whom elegance was not much known or studied at
that period; though it is evident they began to have s taste lor it,
from the eagerness with which they sought lor works of that
lrind. Corinth was lor along time the grem emporium of every
thing that was elegant in the nrts3 aad was, according to the
observation of Paul Orosius, for many ages, “velut officina
omnium artificium, atque artificiorum.''’
