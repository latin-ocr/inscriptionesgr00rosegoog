with an active sense; and that it never was, nor ever could bc,
subjoined to the preposition rard for the same reason that,
though in English we say, “ throco down,’' “brot donn,”
‘⁴ liunt doron’* &c we never say, “ injure domn,'' “wrong ἀσκῶ
“ hart docon‚” hcc. ’

The ellipsis of the causal preposition, as before harper-
ομὲνων, ia common: but lcan lind no other instance of this
participle, or the verb to which it belongs, ina passive form3
probably for no other reason than because there is vro other
passage estant in which it is required in a passive sense.

ΡΕΤΑΣ or drea may possibly mean of an ἑταιρεῖαι or
association, sanctioned by law, of persons linble or qualibed to
serve the higher offices of the state, and therefore constituting
the first order. ,

ΤΕΛΕΣΤΑ, n person <ff the second order, I derive from·
τελεῖν, to pay public contributions; that is, in the language of
modern polity, pnyr'ng scot, or of the class which the French
call corrtribnables. Those at the 'head of the state were in many
places called the τέλη, or oi ἑν τέλειε but the priesthood
never formed a distinct order in any of the Greek states, aa they
did in Egypt and Persia; aud still less the mystagogues or iui-
tiators, which rehdcrrar, in areligious sense, can only mean.
Here it evidently significan rank or order between ΡΕΤΑΣ the
highest, and ΔΑΜΟΣ the lowest of persons responsible to the
state; thetis, of free persons3 slaves being amennble to those
whose property they were.

ln the Dorian treaty, however, preserved in the fifth book
of Thucydides, crac significa a citizen generally: wherefore it
probably does so here, as τελὲστα does a free inhabitant psying,
and δᾶμος one not paying contributions; neither having the
right of suffrage, which was almost every where hereditnry.

The construction of the latter part of the eighth and begin-
· ning of the ninth line, here admitted, is certainly somewhat
barsh3 and the late learned Dr. Vincent endeavoured to soften
it by ingeniously suggesting, that γραφεα might be the plural of
Ὑράφος, ah obsolete form of γραφὴ as ndhroc and ἄλκας are
found on an ancient earthen vase for μόλπη and ἄλκη. Butif
we admit such asorm to have existed, it could only have signi·
fied the writing itself, not that which it commemorated 3 where· ,
aa the fine is evidently for violating the treaty, not for defscing
the letters which recorded it. As for Mr. J. M.'s present op-
