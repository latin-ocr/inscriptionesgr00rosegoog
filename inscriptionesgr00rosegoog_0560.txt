“ Sir,

“1 have writ too much for an extempore re·
mark, and too rinle sorau accurate discussion, ifl was amongst
my books. is you ehew it to Mr. Chishull, pray let it go no
further3 nor bring me into a public dispute. l’ll dispute with
nobody about nothing3 much lese about this witha person sor·
whose great learning l herese just respect, and whose laboure
in hand l wirh so well ιο.

ΙἸΙ add one remark, because here’s peper yet to spere.
Moneieur Tournesort brought out οξ Greece a short inserip-
tion on n basis et Delos, on which formerly stood ιι coloss '⁵

statue of Apolio; the letters are of the same form with our
Sigean monument; in present letters thus:

οα Ρυτο λιθο ep ανδριας και το σφελας.

Father Montfnucon rende ir thur:
Ἑν τῶ λίθω εἰμὶ ἀνδρὶας καὶ τὲ σφέλας.
ln lapide sum statueret basis.

This is justiy censured by Mr.Chishu11, as both varying
from the original, aud void os all good sense. Mr. Chiehull
goes exactly to the letters, and reads thus3

ov αὑτοῦ λίθου εἰμὶ ἀνδρίας καὶ τὰ σφέλας.
Non sum ejusdem lapidis et statueret besis.

But wirhall submissiore, even thir nense seems too lew, end
not worthy to be said ιο eil spectatore. For what wonder thet
the strnue¹ end hesir should he of different stenes, when in rhe
greater statues ’twas ecerce ever otherwise, the statue being
hired and eoidered to the bertr I’ll try my hand at it, and
shall keep exeetly to the letrers3 only beg leave to suppose n
Ταν, which in above 2000 years may heve been worn our et'rhe
beginning. 1 read, τοῦ αὑτοῦ λίθον εἰμ’, rr. τ. λ. Ex eodem
lepide snm sterne etheris. Ther ie to the then pronunciatihh, ’
and in the now orthogmphy

Tavrori λίθου εἰμ’ ἀνδρίας καὶ ro* σφέλας.
Which is a true Iamhic verse, and that establishee the eor*

rectiou. This indeed was worth telliug; ῑο be both os the seme
stone, in a coloss, was both costly and extraordinary.”
