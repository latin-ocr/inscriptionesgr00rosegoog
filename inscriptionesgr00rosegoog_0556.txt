l read and distinguish the second inscription thius:

wmsllrov sini τοῦ Ἑρμοκράτους τοῦ Προκονησ(ιόυ rro'yoi) ⁴
Et ego snrn (donum) Phanodici Hermocratis F. Proconesii.
This, l take it, was engraved upon the second‘vessel5
aud by rra'yoi (ond l too) indicates both itself and the other. ·
lt follows in the inscription κρατῆρα κᾶπίστατοο
sol ἦθμὸν ἐς Πρυτανεῖον edura μνῆμα crystetes. As in
other places of this inscription, arrd many ethera, both Greek
and Latin, there's a plain blunder of the stone-cutter
κδωκα lor idom and the necessity of the sense obliges us
to charge him with another blunder in this same word ἔδωκα
fordione, as in the former inscription. lf he had not rnsde
-κ for ε, l should have suspected he triade it in the first

ἔδωκας because he might take κάγώ to belong to the letter¹ ·

clause and not to the first But egregious negligence in
making a consonant lor a vowel prevents this conjecture.

It follows 'Eds δέ τι πάσχω scheda ινέν eo or'yerer.
· Between rvsv and so one letter is worn ont in tbe stone:
that is not hard to be supplied, and l read it thus: 'Eds
δέ τι πάσχω usbida ‘lv' s'vdtio σιγειεσι. Si qnid autem
(detrimenti) passus luerit, cura (erit) nbi opus habeam Sige-
ensibns. Mshs'd[q (AEolice Mentha] is in this sense used
by Hippocrates: und 'ln' s’vls'o is known, ond common
Greek, and comes most pat to the sentence. The ¹graver
seems to have missed the lota in σιγειες, bnt it may be
read σιγειεῖς in the nominative case: remedium (erunt)
Sigeenses. The last clause is καὶ μ’ ἐποίησεν uisuros
καὶ ἀδελφοὶ. Et fetis me AEsopus et fratres. This well
agrees with the three vessels, if we suppose these inscriptions
engraved on them, AEsop, a silversmith or brezier, and his
two brothers, nrade each of thern one of them.

I shall now consider Mr. Cbisbnll's explication, where
it differs horn my own He supposes this stone to bave ¹
been the basis to a statue of Phanodicus: that this in-
scription is spoken as in the person ol' Phanodicus: that .
the inscription was at first but one, tbe lower of the two:
the upper being ao interpolation of the lower, wrote rnany
years ulter it, and adapted to the writing and lsugnsge
ol that respective recenter nge.

Now, in the lirst place, there arc no lootsteps lest ol
this supposed statue, it is mere conjecture, and if it urises
